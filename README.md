# Play a game of Hangman
To create this little console based hangman game I followed a tutorial from Codédex by Daniel Li (https://www.codedex.io/projects/build-a-word-guessing-game-with-python).

## Add-ons and changes
- Later added a welcoming message asking the user if he want's to play the game. If 'yes' it's started, if 'no' the program is exited.
- Added a stick figure to visualize the classic hangman.
- Also changed the word list to the countries of europe, according to this site: https://www.worldometers.info/de/geografie/wie-viele-laender-in-europa/ (12/2025).
- Added a guessed letters tracking system.
